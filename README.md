##### Lab 1 I used a double for loop to create stars and also used other shapes to create an outer space theme
#### Lab 3 I created bubbles that moved up and down the Y axis and checked for boundaries so the bubbles would reverse when they hit the top or bottom
### Lab 6 I used classes to help create lines that would in the end, create a cool background
## Lab 7 I used the graphics and sound library to create a motivational mirror 
# Lab 8 I used the processing PDF library and created a motivational posted and turned it into a PDF file
